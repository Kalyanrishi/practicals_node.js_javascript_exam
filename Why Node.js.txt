1) Why Node.js
Ans: Node.js uses asynchronous programming.
Asynchronous programming lets you run multiple tasks without waiting for one to finish.
A commom task for a web server can be to open a file on the server and return the content to the client.
Here is how Node.js handels a file request:
* Sends the task to the computer file system.
* Ready to handle the next request.
* When the filemsystem has to open and read the file, the server returns the content to the client.
Node.js eliminates the waiting and simply continues with the next request.
Node.js runs single-threaded, non-blocking, asynchronous programming, which is very memory efficient.
